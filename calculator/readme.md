a simple project that, when given a (well written) mathematical expression, returns the output.
it supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponential (^) and square roots ("sqrtx" or "sqrt(x op y)", don't put brackets if the argument of square root is a single number).
can only read integers, but returns floats as well. supports only well-written expressions.
still needs a lot of debug and optimization.
